    item2: 'How many chains will exist after REI Network Mainnet launch?',
    item2_a:'REI Network is a chain. In the initial stage, taking the interests of those who have staked on GXChain into account, the GXChain will keep running for about half a year (the longest GXChain staking period is 6 months), and GXChain will be suspended after half a year, thus only REI Network will remain.',
    item3: 'Will the username/wallet address be updated at the same time?',

    item4: 'How to swap GXC tokens in other wallets into REI tokens?',
    item4_a:'GXC token in other wallets needs to be transferred to GXC Wallet first, and then exchanged and split through the official converter.',
    item5: 'Any attention should be paid to the use of REI Network? Is it difficult to use?',
    item5_a: 'Compared to GXChain, REI Network is smoother, with higher TPS, lower gas fee, and  EVM-compatible. In addition to using it in the official wallet, it can also be used in the Metamask wallet. '
