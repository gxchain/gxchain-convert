    item1: 'How will REI Network conduct a token swap?',
    item1_a:'1) The GXC tokens in the crypto exchanges (such as Binance, Upbit, Huobi, etc.) will be automatically replaced and split into REI;<br>2) The GXC token in GXC wallet will be replaced and split through the official swap tool;<br>3) GXC staked can be replaced and split through the official converter after it is unlocked (the official converter will keep running for more than one year)',
    item2: 'How many chains will exist after REI Network Mainnet launch?',
    item2_a:'REI Network is a chain. In the initial stage, taking the interests of those who have staked on GXChain into account, the GXChain will keep running for about half a year (the longest GXChain staking period is 6 months), and GXChain will be suspended after half a year, thus only REI Network will remain.',
    item3: 'Will the username/wallet address be updated at the same time?',
    item3_a: 'Because GXChain and REI Network adopt different underlying technologies and different private key generation methods, the username of the GXChain wallet will not be applied to REI Network, and the wallet will be updated at the same time.',
    item4: 'How to swap GXC tokens in other wallets into REI tokens?',
    item4_a:'GXC token in other wallets needs to be transferred to GXC Wallet first, and then exchanged and split through the official converter.',
    item5: 'Any attention should be paid to the use of REI Network? Is it difficult to use?',
    item5_a: 'Compared to GXChain, REI Network is smoother, with higher TPS, lower gas fee, and  EVM-compatible. In addition to using it in the official wallet, it can also be used in the Metamask wallet. '
